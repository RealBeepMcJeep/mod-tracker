# Changelog

## 2026-09-09

- Corrected the deterministic collection scope to 10 Thunderstore pages per ranking and exactly one 80-item Nexus GraphQL page; added distinct-ID validation and stale Nexus listing cleanup.
- Added the manual `collect`, `report`, and `verify` CLI pipeline with atomic flat-file persistence and resumable detail caches.
- Added Nexus GraphQL collection, v1 detail caching, runtime-only API-key authentication, and optional authenticated HTML capture from a caller-supplied cookie file.
- Added Thunderstore collection for both required rankings, package metric/detail capture, ranking appearances, and canonical source deduplication.
- Added normalized cross-source records, idempotent observations, lifetime download rates, and observed current-version download rates.
- Added a single searchable, source-filterable, sortable HTML report with fixed pinned cards and optional embedded thumbnails.
- Added stdlib `unittest` coverage for parsing, normalization, rates, collectors, persistence, reporting, verification, and CLI defaults.
- Confirmed the Valheim package listing, `last-updated` and `most-downloaded` ranking scope, 20-card page size, and requested card metadata.
- Initialized the stdlib-only flat-file project structure and documentation.
